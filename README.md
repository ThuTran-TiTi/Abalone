# Abalone Age Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project employs different machine learning methods to predict the age (rings) of abalones. The analysis is conducted using a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone).

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement various machine learning techniques to accurately predict the age of abalones based on relevant features provided in the dataset.

## Methods Used

- Multiple linear regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- R programming language

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone). It includes features such as measurements and physical characteristics of abalones, with the target variable being the age (rings).
